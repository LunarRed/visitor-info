# visitor-info

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theboolean/visitor-info.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theboolean/visitor-info)

Tiny library that wraps other modules useful to gather information about a visitor in Javascript, such as `browser`, `timezone`, `country`, `OS`, etc...

It is useful in case you want to find fast information about the user without making requests to a third party API service, but relying on the capabilities of the browser.
